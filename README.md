# Would-You-Rather Project

This is the second Project of the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. The main aim of this project is to provide good knowledge about redux and how to use actions,reducers and middlewares with redux to manage state easily. This project is basically a voting website in which different users can create questions and can also vote by choosing their option about particular question. The final rank of users is displayed on leaderboard and is calculated based on number of questions user created and answered.
